# 🕷️ Web Scraping for Business Insights

This repository contains a Python script for web scraping, developed as part of my learning process in data analysis and business reporting.

## 📌 Overview

The script collects structured data from websites using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. This data can be used for analysis, reporting, and deriving business insights when APIs are not available or suitable.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice and understand web scraping techniques.
- Collect real-world data to use in business analysis and reporting.
- Learn how to automate data collection workflows.
- Lay a foundation for building end-to-end data pipelines.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fazeelibtesam/Web_Scraping.git
cd Web_Scraping
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
## ▶️ Usage

Run the scraper using:

```bash
python Web_Scraper.ipynb
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Inside `scraper.py`, you can customize:

* **Target URLs** – change the base URL or list of pages to scrape.
* **Output Format** – switch between CSV, Excel, or JSON as needed.

## 🧠 How This Helps in Your Analysis Journey

Building your own dataset through web scraping is a powerful step toward becoming a more effective analyst. With this project, you:

* Learn to collect tailored data specific to your analysis needs.
* Bypass API limitations or data silos by creating your own source.
* Improve the quality and relevance of your datasets for business reporting.
* Gain a deeper understanding of the data lifecycle—from raw collection to final insights.

This tool empowers you to take control of your data, making your analysis more flexible, creative, and insightful.

## 🤔 Why I Practiced This

I built this project while learning skills essential for business analytics and reporting. It helped me:

* Understand how to gather data from the web when APIs are unavailable.
* Prepare datasets for visualization and analysis.
* Develop a foundational understanding of real-world data acquisition challenges.

This practice also supports creating automated pipelines for regular business reporting.
